# Generative-Models

Text generation using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) is a deep learning approach to generating new text samples. The process involves training a neural network model on a large corpus of text data to learn the patterns and structure of the language. The model consists of two parts: a generator that creates text samples, and a discriminator that evaluates the generated samples and determines whether they are real or fake. The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial manner, with the generator trying to generate text samples that fool the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to correctly identify real and fake samples. The goal is to generate text samples that are diverse and coherent in nature, and that match the patterns and structures learned from the training data. After the model is trained, it can be used to generate new text samples, making it useful for various applications such as natural language processing, chatbots, and content creation.

To create a deep learning model using GANs for text generation in Python, you can follow these steps:

* Preprocess the text data: Clean and preprocess the corpus of text data to get it in the desired format for feeding into the GAN model.
* Define the Generator Model: Design a generator model that takes in random noise as input and generates text samples as output.
* Define the Discriminator Model: Create a discriminator model that takes in generated text samples and determines if they are real or fake.
* Train the Model: Train both the generator and discriminator models together by using adversarial loss and updating the weights of both models based on the results of each iteration.
* Generate Text Samples: After the model is trained, you can use the generator to generate new text samples.
* Evaluate the generated samples: Evaluate the generated text samples to ensure they are diverse and coherent in nature.

# generative_models.py

This code is a implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating text samples. The code defines 3 models, the generator, the discriminator, and the GAN.

The generator model takes a noise vector of shape (batch_size, input_dim) as input and outputs text sequences of shape (batch_size, seq_length, hidden_dim). It uses a dense layer, batch normalization and LSTM layer to generate the text sequences.

The discriminator model takes in text sequences of shape (batch_size, seq_length, input_dim) and outputs a binary classification with shape (batch_size, seq_length, 1) indicating whether the input text sequence is real or fake. It uses LSTM, batch normalization and dense layers to perform the classification.

The GAN model combines the generator and discriminator models. It takes in noise vectors and outputs the generated text sequence along with the binary classification result. The model is then compiled using binary cross entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.

The code trains the GAN model for a specified number of epochs and batches. In each iteration, a batch of real text data is obtained and used to train the discriminator. The generator is then used to generate fake text data and this is also used to train the discriminator. The loss from both real and fake text data training is used to update the weights of the discriminator. The loss from the discriminator is then backpropagated to the generator to update its weights.

Here are a few stuff that I will be doing to enhance this project:

* Model evaluation: Add some evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or perplexity to evaluate the performance of the model and monitor the progress of the training process.

* Data augmentation: Try data augmentation techniques such as adding random noise, random rotations, flipping, or cropping the input data to increase the diversity of the data and prevent overfitting.

* Hyperparameter tuning: Try different hyperparameters such as different batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, or number of hidden units in the models to improve the performance of the model.

* Different loss functions: Experiment with different loss functions such as mean squared error, categorical cross-entropy, or Wasserstein loss to improve the performance of the model.

* Model architecture: Try different model architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers to improve the performance of the model.

* Generated text analysis: Analyze the generated text by comparing it to the real text data, checking for grammar, and measuring the quality of the generated text in terms of coherence and consistency.
